## Context  

For this assignment I went for a drop down nav bar toggled with a hamburger menu icon located on the top left side of the screen. 

I initially tried to use SVG icons inside of buttons but was having issues with them overlapping and the clickable area was way too small.

I then decided to go with an icon built with CSS pseudo elements and a little animation to go along with it.

The menu toggles with an eventListener on click whereas the button animation is based on the boolean value of the menu being open (true) or closed (false).

Took your feedback for README markdown formatting and stopped using backslash line breaks. This one looks much cleaner!
