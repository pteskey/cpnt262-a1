## Context  
---

For this assignment I went for a drop down nav bar toggled with a hamburger menu icon located on the top left side of the screen. 

I initially tried to use SVG icons inside of buttons but was having issues with them overlapping and the clickable area was way too small.

I then decided to go with an icon built with CSS pseudo elements and a little animation to go along with it.
